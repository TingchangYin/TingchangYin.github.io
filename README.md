<!--## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/qq1012510777/qq1012510777.github.io/edit/main/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/qq1012510777/qq1012510777.github.io/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.

## Welcome to Tingchang's page

I am a fourth-year PhD student in Westlake University, China now, under the supervision of [Prof. Sergio Torres](https://en-soe.westlake.edu.cn/OurSchool/Faculty/PI/201912/t20191206_2506.shtml). My research interests include: (i) modeling flow and particle transport in fracture networks; (ii) GPU-acceleration with high performance computating; (iii) application of the percolation theory; and so on. I am developing an open-source CUDA C++ code, [_cuDFNsys_](https://github.com/qq1012510777/cuDFNsys), which is able to do: (i) discrete fracture network (DFN) representations, (ii) steady-state flow simulations in DFNs (with the mixed hybrid finite element method), and (iii) particle tracking. The code aims at running Monte Carlo simulations with e.g. super computers, and has been released publicly.
