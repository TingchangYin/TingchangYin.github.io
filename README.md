    <h2>Welcome to Tingchang's page</h2>
    <p>I am a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Weizmann Institute of Science, working under the guidance of <a href="https://www.weizmann.ac.il/EPS/Brian/">Brian Berkowitz</a>. I received my PhD degree from Zhejiang University, China, under the supervision of <a href="https://m3.westlake.edu.cn/">Sergio Torres</a> at Westlake University. I am studying flow and transport in fractured porous media.</p>

    <h2>Hard Time - Jun 26, 2025</h2>
    <p>During the Twelve-Day War, international members of the Weizmann Institute of Science were relocated to a hotel in Jerusalem. Throughout the conflict, we gathered in underground shelters approximately three times each night. Over those twelve days, many sought various means to leave Israel, while some of us chose to remain. This is a group photo taken after the ceasefire agreement was reached. I was sitting in the front row, second from the right.</p>
