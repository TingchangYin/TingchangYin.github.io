<!--## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/qq1012510777/qq1012510777.github.io/edit/main/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

- Bulleted __rtt
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/qq1012510777/qq1012510777.github.io/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.

## Welcome to Tingchang's page

I am a PhD student in Westlake University now, under the supervision of [Prof. Sergio Torres](https://en-soe.westlake.edu.cn/OurSchool/Faculty/PI/201912/t20191206_2506.shtml). My research interests include: (i) simulation of flow and particle transport in fracture networks; (ii) GPU-acceleration for high performance computating; (iii) application of percolation theory; and so on. I am developing an in-house (C++ and cuda) code which is able to do: (i) discrete fracture network (DFN) representation, (ii) stead-state flow simulation in DFNs (with the mixed hybrid finite element method), and (iii) random walk particle movement (still debuging). The code aims at running Monte Carlo simulations with e.g. super computer, and may be released publicly in the future.
